**### Comprehensive Report on DENOVO Genome Assembly & Quality Analysis of E.coli**

\#### Introduction

This report outlines the steps performed to analyze the quality of the genome assembly generated for \*Escherichia coli\* using the SPAdes assembler. The assembly was assessed against a reference genome to evaluate its completeness, accuracy, and structural integrity. The analysis included various metrics that provide insights into the assembly's performance and potential areas for improvement.

\##  Steps Performed

1\. \*\*Assembly Generation\*\*:

   - The initial step involved generating the genome assembly using SPAdes with trimmed paired-end reads of \*E. coli\*. This process aimed to reconstruct the genome from sequencing data, resulting in a set of contigs.

2\. \*\*Quality Assessment with QUAST\*\*:

   - \*\*Genome Statistics\*\*: The assembly was evaluated for key statistics, including genome fraction, duplication ratio, total aligned length, and N50 values. These metrics help determine how much of the assembled genome corresponds to the reference and how fragmented the assembly is.

   - \*\*Misassembly Detection\*\*: The analysis identified misassemblies, relocations, and misassembled contigs. This step is critical for detecting structural errors within the assembly that could affect downstream analyses.

   - \*\*Unaligned Contigs Analysis\*\*: The number of fully and partially unaligned contigs was quantified. This metric indicates regions of the genome that did not align with the reference genome, suggesting potential gaps or repetitive sequences in the assembly.

   - \*\*Mismatch and Indel Analysis\*\*: The report included counts of mismatches and insertions/deletions (indels) compared to the reference genome. These statistics are essential for assessing the accuracy of base calling in the assembled sequences.

3\. \*\*Statistics Without Reference\*\*:

   - Metrics such as total number of contigs, largest contig length, and overall assembly length were calculated without reference alignment. This provides a comprehensive view of the assembly's structure independent of any reference genome.

4\. \*\*Reference Genome Comparison\*\*:

   - The characteristics of the reference genome were documented, including its length and GC content. This comparison aids in evaluating how well the assembled contigs represent the actual genomic structure of \*E. coli\*.

5\. \*\*Report Generation\*\*:

   - A detailed report was generated summarizing all findings from the analysis. It included visual representations of key metrics, allowing for an intuitive understanding of assembly quality.

6\. \*\*Interpretation of Results\*\*:

   - Each metric was interpreted to assess overall assembly quality. High values in genome fraction and low misassembly counts are indicative of a successful assembly, while high numbers of unaligned contigs or misassemblies highlight areas needing further refinement.

\#### Conclusion

The analysis provided a thorough evaluation of the \*E. coli\* genome assembly generated by SPAdes. By employing tools like QUAST, we were able to quantify various aspects of assembly quality, offering insights into both strengths and weaknesses in the reconstruction process. This report serves as a foundation for potential improvements in future assemblies and guides subsequent genomic analyses such as variant calling or functional annotation.

**Steps:**

1. **_prefetch SRR31120419 (#download the NCBI SRA toolkit beforehand)_**

The command prefetch SRR31120419 downloads sequence data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Here’s a breakdown of what this command does:

prefetch: This is a tool from the SRA Toolkit, which is used to download sequence data files from the SRA. It retrieves the data in the SRA format, which is a compressed format used by NCBI.

SRR31120419: This is the accession number of the specific sequence run you want to download.

\#It is associated with  BioProject with accession number PRJNA218110 is titled "PulseNet Escherichia coli and Shigella genome sequencing". This project is part of a public health initiative aimed at sequencing and assembling Escherichia coli and Shigella species genomes.

2. **_fasterq-dump SRR31120419.sra --split-files_** 

The command fasterq-dump SRR31120419.sra --split-files is used to convert SRA files into FASTQ format, which is more commonly used for downstream bioinformatics analyses.--split-files: This option tells fasterq-dump to split the output into separate FASTQ files for paired-end reads. If the SRA file contains paired-end sequencing data, this will generate two FASTQ files, one for each read in the pair (e.g., SRR31120419\_1.fastq and SRR31120419\_2.fastq)

   - Both Surviving: Out of the total reads, 462,638 (34.03%) had both reads (forward and reverse) long enough to be retained after trimming.

   - Forward Only Surviving: 308,269 (22.67%) of reads had only the forward read surviving.

   - Reverse Only Surviving: 283,270 (20.84%) had only the reverse read surviving.

   - Dropped Reads: A total of 305,346 (22.46%) reads were discarded during the trimming process.

3)

4) Completion Status:

   - The final line confirms that Trimmomatic completed successfully.

To calculate the coverage of the _E. coli_ genome based on the provided  reads, you can use the formula:

Coverage=(Read Count×Read Length)/Total Genome Size

​


## Step-by-Step Calculation<a id="h.k5vdkplwcqa5"></a>

1. Determine Read Count: From your previous Trimmomatic output, you have:

   - Total input read pairs: 1,359,523

   - Since these are paired-end reads, the total read count is:

   - Total Reads=1,359,523×2=2,719,046

   - Total Reads=1,359,523×2=2,719,046

   -

2. Determine Read Length: Assuming an average read length of 250 base pairs (which is common for Illumina sequencing):

   - Read Length: 250 bp

3. Total Genome Size: The size of the _E. coli_ genome is approximately 4.6 million base pairs (4.6 Mb).

4. Calculating this gives:

Coverage≈147.8


## Result<a id="h.w6srrjboro3r"></a>

The estimated coverage for your _E. coli_ genome based on the provided reads is approximately 148×.


## Interpretation<a id="h.lo5kpmyfz7re"></a>

- A coverage of 148× is considered very high and should provide a robust assembly with a low likelihood of missing bases or regions in the genome.

- This level of coverage is generally sufficient for high-quality de novo assembly and variant detection.
